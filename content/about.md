# About me

## Who I am
Hi, my name is Suraj (S.) Singh. I am currently a coding instructor at Coding Minds Academy.

## Preferred Pronouns
I mostly prefer use of my name over pronouns when ever possible (avoids confusion), however my most preferred pronoun is: ***he/him/his***.
*Example: **He** went to open **his** book, which was **his** as of last year and had been with **him** ever since.*

Other acceptable pronouns is: ***they/them/their/theirs***. 
*Example: **They** went to open **their** book, which was **theirs** as of last year and had been with **them** ever since.*
