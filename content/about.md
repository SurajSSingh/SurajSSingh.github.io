# About me

## Who I am
Hi, my name is Suraj (S.) Singh. I am currently a coding instructor at Coding Minds Academy.

## Preferred Pronouns
I most prefer use of my name over pronouns when ever possible (avoids confusion), however an acceptable pronoun is: ***he/him/his***.
*Example: **He** went to open **his** book, which was **his** as of last year and had been with **him** ever since.*

Other acceptable pronouns is: ***they/them/their/theirs***. 
*Example: **They** went to open **their** book, which was **theirs** as of last year and had been with **them** ever since.*

## Interests
I am interested in game development and education, and particularly the intersection between them. I am curiosity about many subjects, from mathematical and technology topics to art and history. I am also very interested in open source technologies.

## What I am Learning
Here is a list of some things I am currently learning about:
* Svelte and SvelteKit
* Rust
* Unreal

## Contact
I don't have much of a social media presence, but I am somewhat available on LinkedIn and GitHub.
