## Overview
The idea is to have a website that can allow one to compare multiple different programming languages (or any kind of programming languages) easily. I primarily wanted to make this website to help catalog all the different ideas from a variety of programming languages to eventually make my own programming language.

## Current Tech Stack
* [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate): Static Site Generator

## Current Status
Hiatus, learning more about other languages to add to the website, considering how to open it up for public contributions, as well as seeing if it can be updated from Slate. Likely to slow ramp up by the end of 2023.
