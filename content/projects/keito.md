## Tagline
Drop yarn balls from above and bounce them to the bored cat below to delight them with colorful yarn! Combine yarn balls of the same color to earn more points.

## Overview
A 3D yarn tossing game made for the P1 February and March game jams.

### Role
I started as C# programmer, focusing in on the yarn physics and dropper/tossing code. Later took on a producer role to help lead meeting, keep everyone on the same page, and get everyone's changes merged in.
