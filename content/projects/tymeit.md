## Overview
A web app that lets you time track from anywhere and privately. This project takes ideas from Nomie and modifies it a bit to make it easier to track specifically with timing. This also let me work on a full project that uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (through SvelteKit) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (through SkeletonUI). Develop following the YouTube tutorial ["Best UI Library for Svelte" by Huntabyte](https://youtu.be/P_A0qQ7AuK8).

## Tech Stack
* [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev): JavaScript (Meta) Framework
* [SkeletonUI](https://www.skeleton.dev): Tailwind Framework

## Current Status
Basic Prototype finished, working on designing stopwatch system and better integrating data from Nomie.
