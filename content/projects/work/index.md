## Coding Minds Academy
Projects I have either worked on or lead the development of at [Coding Minds Academy](https://codingmindsacademy.com/).

### Unity Curriculum Templates
These are curriculum projects/exercises I had a hand in developing for a variety of levels for the Unity curriculum.

* [Original Unity 2 Templates](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Unity-2-Templates):
    * [Unity 2 - Old Platforming Template](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Unity-2-Platforming-Game): Template to help guide with developing a 2D Platformer. Used to help teach how to use Unity's tilemap system, understand 2D physics, and save data across levels.
    * [Unity 2 - RTS Template](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Unity_2_RTS_Game): A simple RTS template to provide scaffolding for learning about inheritance and polymorphism.
* [Unity 2 - Tower Defense Template](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Unity-2-Tower-Defense-Templat): A simple tower defense game used to help teach Unity's scriptable object. Modified from the Unity 2 RTS project to reduce the number of things students need to learn about the template and replaces it in the curriculum.
* [Unity 2 - New Platforming Template](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Unity-2-Platforming-Template): An updated 2D platform for Unity 2, focusing on improving assets and clearer lesson flow.
* [Unity 2 - Module 3 Exercises](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Unity-2-Module-3---Unity-Exercises): 5 exercise scenes to help reinforce Unity concepts learned. Each exercise is a mini-game, including a UI-only guess the number game, 3D cannonball simulator, and 3D platformer.
* [Unity 3 - Module 1 Obstacle Course](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Obstacle-Course-Project): A simple 3D obstacle course that is used to teach Unity' new Input System and local computer multiplayer.
* [Unity 3 - Multiplayer Pong Template](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/MultiplayerPongTemplate): A simple Pong setup framework to help teach multiplayer using Unity's Netcode for GameObjects.
* [Unity 3 - Steam NGO Example](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Steam_NGO_Example): A set of scenes showing how to combine Steam and Unity's Netcode for GameObject.
* [Unity 4 - ML-Agents Example](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/ML-Agents-Example): A set of prefabs and scripts used to bootstrap working with [Unity's ML-Agents package](https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agent).
       

### Student Projects
These are some student projects I helped with. For these project, I primarily assisted with programming and game design based on input from students. All the game presented here were made in Unity using C#.
