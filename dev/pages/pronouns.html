    <h1 class="text-center">My Preferred Pronouns</h1>
    <h2>Main Preference</h2>
    <p>I mostly prefer use of my name over pronouns when ever possible (avoids confusion), however my most preferred pronoun is:
    </p>
    <p><em>he/him/his</em></p>
    <p>Example: <strong>He</strong> went to open <strong>his</strong> book. The book has been <strong>his</strong> since last
        year
        and kept close to <strong>him</strong>.</p>
    <h2>Other Acceptable Pronouns</h2>
    <p><em>they/them/their/theirs</em></p>
    <p>Example: <strong>They</strong> went to open <strong>their</strong> book. The book has been <strong>theirs</strong> since
        last
        year
        and kept close to <strong>them</strong>.</p>
