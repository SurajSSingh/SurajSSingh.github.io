  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The idea is to have a website that can allow one to compare multiple different programming languages (or any kind of programming languages) easily. I primarily wanted to make this website to help catalog all the different ideas from a variety of programming languages to eventually make my own programming language.</p>
<h2>Current Tech Stack</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/slatedocs/slate">Slate</a>: Static Site Generator</li>
</ul>
<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>Migrating from Slate to <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>. This will help simplify the build process, allowing for faster iteration.</p>
