</ul>
<h2>What I accomplished</h2>
<p>Finished all the steps from the guide, now working on making some interesting improvements such as adding a <a href='https://alhassy.com/TypedLisp.html'>type-system</a> and adding a more <a href='https://readable.sourceforge.io/'>readable syntax.</a></p>
<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>Hiatus, learning more about other Lisps to see what I can bring into the language.</p>
