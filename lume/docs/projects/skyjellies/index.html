  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SkyJellies is a 3D adventure and resource management game designed to help teach empathy. Your character lands on a planet with jelly creatures that you take care of by gathering, building, and crafting.</p>
<h3>Role</h3>
<p>I started work on the prototype as a C# programmer. I worked with other programmers to help diagnosis and fix a bug in the non-player character pathfinding by adjusting NavMesh agent properties. I also worked on creating unit test for Player movement, learning how to structure test in Unity.</p>
<p>During the transition to open source, I help guide my contributions to the open source repository, so that others could continue work on it.</p>
