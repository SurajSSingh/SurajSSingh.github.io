# About me

## Who I am

A life-long learner curious about the world and driven to help others learn. I
am eager to build interactive learning experiences that simplifies complex ideas
and enhances learning by connecting students to the content they learn. My hope
is to make knowledge accessible to as many people as possible.

Graduated from UCI with a dual degree in Computer Game Science (B.S.) and
Education Science (B.A.) and UIUC with a Masters of Computer Science; through my
academic journey, I have worked through the video game development process,
learned about how people learn, and built connections between the theoretical
and application sides of computer science.

Working as a coding instructor at Coding Minds Academy, I have provided guidance
to K-12 students through the world of STEM using project-based lessons. Applying
what I learned through my academic work, I passed on that knowledge and mentored
students through development of their projects, from helping with writing a
machine learning programming in Python, to developing video games with Unity and
helping them release their game online.

I have volunteered time as a Unity programmer at P1 Virtual Civilization, an
organization dedicated to building ethical virtual worlds. My contribution
focused on fixing bugs and implementing features for the player-NPC interaction
in the Skyjellies game. As new volunteers joined our organization, I have helped
out with getting them oriented and ready to contribute.

## Interests

I have a passion for game development and education, and exploring the dynamic
intersection where creativity meets learning. My curiosity is boundless, diving
deep into a wide array of subjectsâ€”from the intricacies of mathematics and
technology to the rich tapestry of art and history. I always strive to pick up
how others teach so that I may be better able to help others understand through
a variety of mediums. I am particularly drawn to the power of open source
technologies, which not only enrich my projects but also foster a sense of
community and innovation. This blend of interests driving me to create immersive
experiences that not only entertain but also educate.

## Preferred Pronouns

I **prefer use of my name** when ever possible (avoids confusion). However,
these are acceptable pronouns:

1. _**he/him/his**_: _Example: **His** book, which was **his** since **he** was
   young, was not with **him**.

2. _**they/them/their/theirs**_: _Example: **Their** book, which was **theirs**
   since **they** were young, was not with **them**._
