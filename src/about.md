# About me

Just a little page about me.

## Who I am

A life-long learner curious about the world and driven to help others learn. I
am eager to build interactive learning experiences that simplifies complex ideas
and enhances learning by connecting students to the content they learn. My hope
is to make knowledge accessible to as many people as possible.

I am currently working as a freelance software developer. My current work is on
a tool that uses Whisper AI to transcribe voice to text from just their mouse.
You can find it here: <https://github.com/SurajSSingh/SuperMouseAI>

I graduated from UCI with a dual degree in Computer Game Science (B.S.) and
Education Science (B.A.) and UIUC with a Masters of Computer Science; through my
academic journey, I have worked through the video game development process,
learned about how people learn, and built connections between the theoretical
and application sides of computer science.

During my academic course work, I also worked as a coding instructor at Coding
Minds Academy, where I provided guidance to K-12 students through the world of
STEM using project-based lessons. Applying what I learned through my coursework,
I passed on that knowledge and mentored students through development of their
projects, from helping with writing a machine learning programming in Python, to
developing video games with Unity and helping them release their game online.

I have volunteered time as a Unity programmer at P1 Virtual Civilization, an
organization dedicated to building ethical virtual worlds. My contribution
focused on fixing bugs and implementing features for the player-NPC interaction
in the [Skyjellies game](https://redeagle-p1.itch.io/skyjellies). As new
volunteers joined our organization, I have helped out with getting them oriented
and ready to contribute.

Later on at P1, I became a team leader/lead programmer and help my team develop
project from design sketches to working prototype demos within a couple of
weeks. These are two game I lead development of: [Keito](../project/keito) and
[Eco Defender](../project/eco-defender). Also, I served as lead adviser for
other team, helping mentor them to produce awesome games. These includes:
[Runes vs Robots](https://chiferito.itch.io/project-tower) and
[License Master](https://mugwanezamanzi.itch.io/license-master).

### Preferred Pronouns

I **prefer use of my name** when ever possible (avoids confusion). However,
these are acceptable pronouns:

1. _**he/him/his**_: _Example: **His** book, which was **his** since **he** was
   young, was not with **him**.

2. _**they/them/their/theirs**_: _Example: **Their** book, which was **theirs**
   since **they** were young, was not with **them**._

What an LLM summurizes my interests as
</summary>
I have a passion for game development and education, and exploring the dynamic
intersection where creativity meets learning. My curiosity is boundless, diving
deep into a wide array of subjectsâ€”from the intricacies of mathematics and
technology to the rich tapestry of art and history. I always strive to pick up
how others teach so that I may be better able to help others understand through
a variety of mediums. I am particularly drawn to the power of open source
technologies, which not only enrich my projects but also foster a sense of
community and innovation. This blend of interests driving me to create immersive
experiences that not only entertain but also educate.

### What I am Learning

Here is a short list of some things I am currently focusing my learning on:

- [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app)
- [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp)

### What I have worked on recently

- [Super Mouse AI](https://github.com/SurajSSingh/SuperMouseAI)
- Nearly daily SILT (Something I Learned Today) on Bluesky and Mastodon

### Small scale personal projects

- Expanded a college project on a robotic small-scale self-driving car, which
  used Python and Electron
- Built a couple of computers, including making a laptop (not exactly difficult
  as [Framework](https://frame.work) makes it easy)
