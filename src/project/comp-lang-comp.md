## Overview

The idea is to have a website that can allow one to compare multiple different
programming languages (or any kind of programming languages) easily. I primarily
wanted to make this website to help catalog all the different ideas from a
variety of programming languages to eventually make my own programming language.

## Current Tech Stack

- [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate): Static Site Generator

## Current Status

Migrating from Slate to [Astro](https://astro.build). This will help simplify
the build process, allowing for faster iteration.
