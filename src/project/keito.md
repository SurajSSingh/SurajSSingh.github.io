## Tagline

Drop yarn balls from above and bounce them to the bored cat below to delight
them with colorful yarn! Combine yarn balls of the same color to earn more
points.

## Overview

A 3D yarn tossing game made for the P1 February and March game jams.

### Role

I started as C# programmer, focusing in on the yarn physics and dropper/tossing
code. Later took on a team lead role to help lead meeting, keep everyone on the
same page, and get everyone's changes merged in.
