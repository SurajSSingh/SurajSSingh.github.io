## Overview

My implementation of Make a Lisp (MAL) done in Rust. Used to learn more about
how to work with Rust, as well as learn more about certain programming concepts
such as tail-call optimization.

## Tech Stack

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): Programming Language

## What I accomplished

Finished all the steps from the guide, now working on making some interesting
improvements such as adding a
<a href='https://alhassy.com/TypedLisp.html'>type-system</a> and adding a more
<a href='https://readable.sourceforge.io/'>readable syntax.</a>

## Current Status

Hiatus, learning more about other Lisps to see what I can bring into the
language.
