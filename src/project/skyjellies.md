## Overview

SkyJellies is a 3D adventure and resource management game designed to help teach
empathy. Your character lands on a planet with jelly creatures that you take
care of by gathering, building, and crafting.

### Role

I started work on the prototype as a C# programmer. I worked with other
programmers to help diagnosis and fix a bug in the non-player character
pathfinding by adjusting NavMesh agent properties. I also worked on creating
unit test for Player movement, learning how to structure test in Unity.

During the transition to [open source](https://github.com/P1Gaming/SkyCore), I
help guide my contributions to the open source repository, so that others could
continue work on it.
