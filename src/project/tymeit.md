## Overview

A web app that lets you time track from anywhere and privately. This project
takes ideas from Nomie and modifies it a bit to make it easier to track
specifically with timing. This also let me work on a full project that uses
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (through SvelteKit) and
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (through SkeletonUI). Develop following
the YouTube tutorial
["Best UI Library for Svelte" by Huntabyte](https://youtu.be/P_A0qQ7AuK8).

### Tech Stack

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev): JavaScript (Meta) Framework
- [SkeletonUI](https://www.skeleton.dev): Tailwind UI Framework

### Current Status

Basic Prototype finished, working on designing stopwatch system, better
integrating data from Nomie, and learn how to make the app into a Progressive
Web Application (PWA).
