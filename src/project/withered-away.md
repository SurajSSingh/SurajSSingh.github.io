## Overview

The capstone project for my Computer Game Science degree. This is a 2D action
platformer where the player has to keep moving or else get subsumed by the
deadly mist. Over the two quarters, I worked on developing level ideas into the
prototype, integrated it with the player and enemy objects, applied the 2D
sprites provided from the artist, and developed music and sound effects for the
final product. I learned how to work from game prototype to final product
publishing in a small group within a constrained time frame. Available for
download on Itch.io for Windows and Mac.
